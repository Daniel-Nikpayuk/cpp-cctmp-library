# cpp-cctmp-library
-------------------

C++17 Continuation Constructing Template Meta Programming Library.

This proof of concept library is currently being migrated (restructured and refactored) to the semiself hosting version.
The previously existing readme documentation is there. I do not intend to update this version of the library any further.
For those who want to test out the proof of concept working versions of my chord and hustle domain specific languages (DSLs),
I have set up simple main.cpp template files named main.cpp.chord, main.cpp.hustle accordingly.

If you want to read through other DSL source code samples, they are located in the following directories:

[chord assembly](testing/chord/assembly/inventory.hpp)
[chord progression](testing/chord/progression/inventory.hpp)
[hustle](testing/hustle/inventory.hpp)

Thank you.
